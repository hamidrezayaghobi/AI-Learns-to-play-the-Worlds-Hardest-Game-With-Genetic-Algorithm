# Playing World Hardest Game Using Genetic Algorithm

## Summery
In this project, we impliment genetic algorithm which can learn to play [World Hardest Game](https://www.crazygames.nl/spel/worlds-hardest-game)

## How to Run:
You can run this game using different method in Solve.py:
1. Run `play_human_mode()` so you can play it by yourself.
2. Run `play_game_AI()` if you want to run a string of movements; for example for running "wwssadw" string. 
3. Rund `run_whole_generation()` if you want to see the evaluation of genetic algorithm.
